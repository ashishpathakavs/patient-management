# üè• Patient Management System (Microservices Architecture)

This is a modular Patient Management Application built using Java Spring Boot and microservices architecture. It features core services such as authentication, patient management, and analytics, and uses Spring Cloud Gateway for routing, gRPC for inter-service communication, and Kafka for asynchronous messaging.
